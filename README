The code creates a simple snake game. The game board is a 30x30 grid, and the snake starts at the position (5, 15). The snake can move up, down, left, or right by pressing the corresponding arrow key. When the snake eats a piece of food, it grows in length. If the snake hits a wall or its own body, the game is over.

The code is divided into several functions:

* `updateFoodPosition()`: This function randomly generates a new position for the food.
* `handleGameOver()`: This function is called when the game is over. It displays an alert message and then reloads the page.
* `changeDirection()`: This function is called when the user presses an arrow key. It changes the direction of the snake.
* `initGame()`: This function is called repeatedly to update the game state. It checks if the snake has eaten a piece of food, and if so, it grows the snake and generates a new piece of food. It also checks if the snake has hit a wall or its own body, and if so, it calls the `handleGameOver()` function.

The code also uses the following variables:

* `gameOver`: This variable is set to `true` when the game is over.
* `foodX` and `foodY`: These variables store the position of the food.
* `snakeX` and `snakeY`: These variables store the position of the snake's head.
* `speedX` and `speedY`: These variables store the snake's direction of movement.
* `snakeBody`: This array stores the positions of the snake's body.
* `setIntervalId`: This variable stores the ID of the interval that is used to repeatedly update the game state.
* `score`: This variable stores the player's score.
* `highScore`: This variable stores the player's high score.
